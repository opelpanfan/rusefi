# Here we facilitate monitoring by exposing model/transfer object of each individual controller. While some entries are only
# useful for monitoring the big idea is to bring calculation and monitoring as close to each other as possible by exposing
# many calculation fields directly
#
# here we have LiveData configuration file
# entry format, where 'key' is a unique ID:
# key: [NameOfJavaToGenerate.java, folder_where_key.txt_is located, (optional advanced options)]
# Naming convention: top level struct in .txt file should be called key_s
# at the moment new line would need to be added into StateDictionary.java manually todo: Add code generation of StateDictionary.java
#
# see gen_live_documentation.sh which is the main generation script
# todo: what is sequence of events in terms of 'live_data_e' code generation?
